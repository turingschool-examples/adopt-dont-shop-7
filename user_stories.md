# User Stories

## Deploy

```
[✓]
0: Deploy your applicant to the internet

As a visitor of the site
I will perform all user stories
By visiting the applicant on the internet.
Localhost is fine for development, but
the applicant must be hosted on the internet.

As a team, choose either Render or Heroku to deploy your project.
Use these guides:

Heroku: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails7
Render: https://backend.turing.edu/module2/misc/deploying_with_render

Continuous Integration / Deployment is not allowed for this project.

## Apply for Pet(s)

Visitors to the site will be able to create applicants to adopt pets. An applicant has many pets. Pets can have many applicants.
