# 12. Approving a Pet for Adoption

# As a visitor
# When I visit an admin application show page ('/admin/applications/:id')
# For every pet that the application is for, I see a button to approve the application for that specific pet
# When I click that button
# Then I'm taken back to the admin application show page
# And next to the pet that I approved, I do not see a button to approve this pet
# And instead I see an indicator next to the pet that they have been approved
